The R code and objects, data, and JAGS models provided here accompany Nuse et al.'s manuscript 'Alternatives to the g(0) = 1 assumption in distance sampling of populations where an individual covariate influences detection'.  There are two subfolders, one addressing the fitting of models to simulated data ('simulations') and the other to do with the case study given in the paper ('case study').  Each subfolder has its own readme file that introduces the accompanying files.
